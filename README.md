# ChampaignPublicWorksVisualization

This is a HackIllinois 2018 project to visualize city work data in the City of Champaign from 2009 to 2017.

To run, you will need an API key for Google Maps. First, clone the repository and create a file called apikeys.py in the main folder. Add the following line to the file:
MAPS_API_KEY = "Insert Your Google Maps API Here"

You can then run "python app.py" from a terminal.

The project modified and added upon the following tutorial for Marker Clustering with the Google Maps Javascript API:
